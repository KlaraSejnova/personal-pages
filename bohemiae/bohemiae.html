          The Bohemiae Rosa Project was started in about 1992 when different
          processes in my life started to interconnect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps the most important impulse is my own long-lasting connection
          to the Czech landscape, especially here at this place, at the top of
          Zebín Hill near Jičín. This is a very historical place, which has been
          admired also by Czech romantic artists, like the poet Karel Hynek
          Mácha. From the top of this hill it is possible to see the whole
          surrounding landscape, called Český Ráj or Bohemian Paradise.
        </p>
        <p>
          My own work developed here practically from childhood – collecting
          pigments, walking around, drawing and observing the environment. From
          the beginning of the 90s - when I started to teach at the Academy of
          Fine Arts in Prague, the impulses of this place and my new role as a
          teacher developed into numerous projects and workshops.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1990 and 91 I worked together with my students on an ecological
          project for the Elbe River with The Harrison’s, and late in 1992 this
          experience transformed into cooperation between the Academy of Fine
          Arts in Prague and the European Association for Architecture and
          Education. The project set out to compare the historic quality of our
          landscape(s) and reflect upon, and develop new methods for teaching
          art – how to define borders and how to find a new sensibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1994 I met Frank van de Ven for the first time. Through his
          introduction to Body Weather, while we were working together on the
          performance Bez Data in the ARCHA theatre in Prague many different
          aspects of my work came together and connected.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea of Bohemiae Rosa became more and more concrete, like walking
          through the landscape. The first meeting and workshop was realised in
          1995 in Mseno, in a sand-rock pre historical landscape. From 1995
          until 2003 Bohemiae Rosa took place bi-annually and we worked in 5
          different National Reserves in the Czech Republic. They were all
          realized with an imaginary respect to Bohuslao Balbinos map of the
          Czech Lands which looks like a Rose. It is from this picture that the
          title of this project: Bohemiae Rosa Project was derived.
        </p>

      <div class="van text" id="van">
        <p>
          From 1983 until 1992 I lived and worked in Japan where I was part of
          Min Tanaka’s dance company Maijuku. It was on tour with them that I
          visited the Czech Republic for the first time in 1984. Performances
          took place at the Junior Club and they were illegal and underground.
          There were no flyers and all the advertising was done by word of
          mouth. After the performance audiences waited for us to come out of
          the dressing room to talk about what they had seen. Czech artists were
          also eager to show us their own work.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1985 in Japan Min realised his long held dream of starting a farm
          and from then on our dance training included working in the rice
          fields and taking care of animals and vegetables. Gradually the
          landscape of the farm in Hakushu seeped into our bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those first performances of Min and Maijuku in the mid 80’ies in the
          Czech Republic and in Poland were organised by Ondrej Hrab. After my
          return to Europe in 1993 Ondrej invited me to do choreography for the
          newly opened Archa theatre in Prague. The performance was called Bez
          Data after a poem of Bohuslav Reynek. I worked with Katerina
          Bakatsaki, who was also part of Maijuku, and with 10 Czech dancers
          whom we trained during several workshops prior to the start of the
          rehearsal process.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was during our work on Bez Data that I met Milos Sejn. He
          performed, he did the set-design and contributed on many levels to the
          performance. We found a common interest in the relation of bodies and
          landscape and right after the Bez Data performance we discussed about
          the outline and focus of the Bohemiae Rosa Project.
        </p>
        <p>
          We planned to visit different landscapes in different Czech Protected
          Areas during a 5 year period, spiralling around Prague and culminating
          in the area called Bohemian Paradise. With Bohemiae Rosa wanted to
          create a platform to deepen and intensify our knowledge about Body and
          Landscape - to research new connections between them and to elaborate
          an educational model for spreading this type of experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the outset an important part was to be the addition of guest
          teachers whose respective disciplines were to be brought in as an
          extra stimulus or mediator of the relation between body and landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the 10 years of touring and performing with Min Tanaka and
          Maijuku and living in Japan I absorbed their philosophy and approach
          to movement and dance. Body Weather as a training and methodology
          develops a conscious relation between spaces inside bodies and spaces
          outside bodies. In the dance I brought back with me from Japan was an
          intrinsic sensitivity and awareness to environment and landscape. But
          I never had a long-lasting relation to any particular physical
          landscape. It was in working with Milos and witnessing and partaking
          of his profound knowledge of - and practical connection to the
          Bohemian Land that I was able to anchor the work done in Japan and
          find a fertile ground upon which to further develop and expand Body
          Weather by working in a variety of Mid European Landscapes and with a
          large number of Czech (and other) students and artists.
