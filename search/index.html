                <h1>Strategies to Protect the Homeland from International Hacking</h1>
                <div class="content">
                    According to the SolarWinds Public Sector Cybersecurity Survey, 56% of federal IT operations and
                    security decision-makers rank foreign governments as the top security threat. What does this mean
                    for agencies and how can they move towards a more secure cybersecurity posture?

                <div class="content">
                    Earlier this year, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) ordered a “strategic
                    review” of its electronic health records (EHR) program. While the words “strategic review” might
                    sound ominous, VA engaging in this review signifies the agency is serious about getting this massive
                    effort right.

                    In the latest Public Sector Cybersecurity Survey Report conducted by SolarWinds,
                    400 public sector IT professionals were surveyed and for the first time in five years, the general
                    hacking community was named the largest source of security threats for the federal government.
